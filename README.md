# A-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-FOR-DIAGNOSIS-OF-PNEUMONIA
1.2 AIM AND OBJECTIVES
The aim of this work is to develop a Machine Learning model for the diagnosis of pneumonia through analyzing patterns in the X-ray image datasets. This will help medical practitioners in taking diagnostic decisions.
The specific objectives are to:
a.	Collect precisely fixed and comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse x-ray images related to pneumonia.
b.	Develop a Machine learning pattern discovery model for pneumonia diagnosis.
c.	Design a Machine Learning model for accurate image pattern discovery for Pneumonia diagnosis to analyze the data and fitting the data into the model.
d.	 Implement and evaluate the performance of the model in (c) above to predict accurate predictions using Convolutional Neural Network.


1.3 METHODOLOGY
In order to achieve the set objectives, the following research methodologies are
employed:
a.	Data collection via the use of X-rays image from Kaggle repository 
b.	System analysis and design tools in the development of the system.
c.	Feature extraction using variety of methods such as grayscale intensity, shape and texture feature.
d.	Training the model to classify images into specific cases of pneumonia or not pneumonia.
e.	Model evaluation to assess the CNN for Image processing classification for accuracy, precision and F1 score.
f.	Deploying the trained model by using the model to generate reports for radiologists
